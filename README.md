Hi Kok Wee and Friends,

Thank you for being open to use your IT skills in ways that can benefit youths-at-risk.

Like what we previously mentioned, I'm writing down some of the ideas that we can explore and learn together:

<h1>The Casenote Web App</h1>

  <p>Adding a ID scanner function to the system so that youths who come for drop-in sessions can easily record their attendance, and check in and out of the drop in sessions just by scanning their ID</p>
  
  <p>Understand the limitations and needs on the ground, and work the system according to the needs, so that the system is adopted easier, and that it would be more relevant to the needs</p>
  

<h1>YGOS Phone App</h1>

  <h2>Building a YGOS phone app on android and iphone platform to serve the following purposes</h2>
  
    <p>Maintain relations with Donors, keeping them updated about the ministry, and ideally facilitate easy donation method</p>
    <p>Maintain relations with volunteers, keeping them updated about volunteering opportunities, invitation to volunteer events</p>
    <p>Integrate Casenote Web App into the Phone App so that caseworkers can easily key in casenotes on the go</p>
    <p>Main platform for caseworkers to share event photos with their youths, to facilitate a safer way of disseminating photos</p>
    <p>Main platform for setting casework appointments with youths, and go-to place for youth-friendly web games</p>
    <p>Efficient way of checking curfew for our youths that are in structured intervention programmes</p>
    

    I'll update to here first. I'll update more in the coming days of the week. Feel free to share thoughts and ideas
